# Unaixial tension of fiber composite
The 2st example is 2 scale FE-SCA analysis. In this example, we use FE-SCA to model the uniaxial tension of a thin plate made of UD fiber composites, where FE is used to model the part scale response, SCA is used to model the microstructure response. The dimension and details of the mesh used in the part scale and microstructure scale is shown in the following figure.

The displacement field of the FE mesh is shown in the figure below.
